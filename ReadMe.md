/* For innovation 3, I learned a little bit more about object-oriented programming. Thoughout the videos, they takled
   about how to create an object and calling methods on an object. For example, when you call a method on an object
   the format would be ' object variable name + . + Method name + (input argument). Also went over operators and what
   they do and if/else statements, which I was already a little more familiar with.
